# Dary

Dary is a library which implements a data structure called Double-Array. Double-Array
is one of the structure of TRIE. Dary can construct a dictionary with reasonable time
consuming, can find value by key very fast. (It only depends on the length of searching
key.)


## Install

    ./configure; make; make install

## How to use

First, build double array index with command 'darybuild'.

    $ darybuild keywords.txt keywords.dary

keywords.txt should contain one keyword per line, need not to be sorted.

Next, search with command 'darysearch'. darysearch do common prefix search by input string.

    $ darysearch keywords.dary
    (Input something)
